Find the difference between two CSVs - with ludicrous speed!ðŸš€

`csv-diff` is a crate for finding the difference between two CSVs.
It is the fastest CSV-diffing library in the world!
Comparing two 1,000,000 rows x 9 columns CSVs takes __under 500ms__.
It is *thread-pool-agnostic*, meaning you can provide your own existing thread-pool
or you can use the default [rayon thread-pool](https://docs.rs/rayon/1.5.0/rayon/struct.ThreadPool.html)
that is used in this crate.

# Use Case
This crate should be used on CSV data that has some sort of *primary key* for uniquely identifying a record.
It is __not__ a general line-by-line diffing crate.
You can imagine dumping a database table in CSV format from your *test* and *prod* system and comparing it
with each other to find differences.

# Overview
The most important structs and enums you will use are:
1. [`CsvDiff`](csv_diff/struct.CsvDiff.html) for comparing two CSVs
2. [`DiffResult`](diff_result/enum.DiffResult.html) for checking whether the two CSVs are different or equal
3. [`DiffRecords`](diff_result/struct.DiffRecords.html) for the actual differences, if the two CSVs are different.
