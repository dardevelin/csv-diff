Find the difference between two CSVs - with ludicrous speed!ðŸš€

`csv-diff` finds the difference between two CSVs.
It is the fastest CSV-diffing library in the world!
Comparing two 1,000,000 rows x 9 columns CSVs takes __under 600ms__ (when using [raw bytes](csv_diff::CsvByteDiffLocal::diff)).
It is *thread-pool-agnostic*, meaning you can provide your own existing thread-pool
or you can use the default [rayon thread-pool](https://docs.rs/rayon/1.5.0/rayon/struct.ThreadPool.html)
that is used in this crate.

# Use Case
This crate should be used on CSV data that has some sort of *primary key* for uniquely identifying a record.
It is __not__ a general line-by-line diffing crate.
You can imagine dumping a database table in CSV format from your *test* and *production* system and comparing it
with each other to find differences.

# Overview
The most important types you will use are:
1. [`CsvByteDiffLocal`](csv_diff::CsvByteDiffLocal) for comparing two CSVs byte-wise in a blocking fashion and getting the result as [`DiffByteRecords`](diff_result::DiffByteRecords).
2. [`CsvByteDiff`](csv_diff::CsvByteDiff) for comparing two CSVs byte-wise lazily and getting the result as an [`Iterator`](diff_result::DiffByteRecordsIterator).
